# gtk3-demo â€” Demonstrate GTK+ widgets

**gtk3-demo** is a collection of examples. Its purpose is to demonstrate many GTK+ widgets in a form that is useful to application developers. The application shows the source code for each example, as well as other used resources, such as ui files and icons.

gtk3-demo is part of the GTK widget library. [hompage](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk3-demo.html)

## Installation

**gtk3-demo** is a native application, therefor a number of manual steps are required. The quickest way to set it up is done using Docker and git.

**Linux** - Docker and git are widely available for nearly all Linux distributions.

**Windows** - To setup Docker for Windows, follow the steps described [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl-tech-preview/). Git for windows is available [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

## Setup - Linux or Windows PowerShell

- `git clone https://github.com/udevbe/greenfield.git`
- `cd greenfield/environments/local`
- `docker-compose up`

This will start 3 Docker containers.

- An app-endpoint-server, has the gtk3-demo-application as launchable application.
- A dummy X server, required be the video encoder to run OpengGL commands. Not used for anything else.
- An nginx server, has ssl termination and uses a self-signed localhost certificate so a secure websocket connection can be set up.

Your browser will, by default, reject the secure websocket connection as it uses a self-signed certificate. 
You can however force your browser to accept the certificate.

- In Firefox, go to https://localhost and simply follow the dialogue and accept the certificate. You should now get a `502 bad gateway` which means
your browser can communicate. This is fine as the app-endpoint-server only handles websocket requests, hence you get a `5xx error`.

Simply close the tab, the certificate has now been permanently accepted.
- In Chrome there is no dialogue button. Go to `chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost` and enable `Allow invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost.`
